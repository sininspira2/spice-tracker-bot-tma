# AGENTS.md for Spice Tracker Bot

This document provides instructions for AI coding agents to contribute to the Spice Tracker Bot project.

## Project Overview

The Spice Tracker Bot is a Python-based Discord bot for the game "Dune: Awakening." It allows guild members to track the conversion of "spice sand" to "melange," manage group expeditions, and oversee a guild treasury.

-   **Backend**: Python with `SQLAlchemy ORM` for database interaction.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL, hosted on Supabase. Schema is managed via Alembic migrations in `alembic/versions/`.
-   **Deployment**: Hosted on Fly.io using a Docker container.
-   **CI/CD**: Uses GitHub Actions for linting, testing, and security checks.

## Data Model: Melange and Sand

-   **Melange**: Always treated as an integer. It is the primary currency and cannot be a fraction.
-   **Sand**: The raw material converted into melange.
-   **Conversion**: The conversion from sand to melange is based on a set ratio (e.g., 50 sand = 1 melange). Any amount of sand that does not meet the threshold for a whole unit of melange remains as leftover sand. For instance, at a 50:1 ratio, 120 sand converts to 2 melange with a remainder of 20 sand.

## Project Structure

-   `bot.py`: Main application entry point. Initializes the bot, registers commands, and handles events.
-   `database_orm.py`: Contains the SQLAlchemy ORM models and the `Database` class for all interactions with the PostgreSQL database.
-   `commands/`: Directory for all bot command implementations. Each command is in its own file.
-   `utils/`: Contains helper modules for embeds, database operations, logging, etc.
-   `alembic/`: Holds database schema migrations and configuration.
-   `tests/`: Contains all pytest tests for the application.

## Development Setup

-   Create a virtual environment and install dependencies.
-   `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` (or `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
-   Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` and populate it with your credentials.
-   To run the bot locally: `python bot.py`

## Testing Instructions

-   The project uses `pytest` for testing.
-   To run the full test suite with coverage: `pytest tests/ -v --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing`
-   All new functionality must include unit tests.
-   Ensure tests pass before committing any code.
-   When reading the database schema, make sure to read the ENTIRE migration history in order to understand the correct, current database structure.

## Code Style and Conventions

-   Follow Python PEP 8 style guidelines.
-   Enforce LF line endings.
-   Use type hints for all function parameters and return values.
-   Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.
-   All database operations should be asynchronous using `async/await`.
-   Use the provided `EmbedBuilder` and `embed_utils` for creating Discord embeds to ensure consistency.
-   Use the custom `logger` from `utils/logger.py` for all logging. It is optimized for Fly.io.

## Security Considerations

-   Never commit API keys, tokens, or other sensitive credentials.
-   Use environment variables for all configuration secrets (e.g., `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `DATABASE_URL`).
-   Admin-level commands are permission-gated using the `is_admin` or `is_officer` functions in `utils/permissions.py`.
-   Validate and sanitize all user inputs, especially for database queries.
